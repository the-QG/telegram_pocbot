<b>The Scared Bear</b>
I’m an old bear, and I know how to find food in
a campsite. When I saw the blue box with the white
top, I knew it would have some cold goodies in it.
If the car it was in was locked, I could easily reach in
one of the open windows to grab some beef jerky.
I lumbered over to the car, almost tasting that chewy
jerky already. Then, the most awful sound came from
the tent: “Mom, look at that huge bear!”
I rushed away to get breakfast somewhere safer. Kids,
with their loud voices and creepy, little hands, have
scared me ever since I was a cub.
