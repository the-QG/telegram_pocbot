<b>Peanut Butter: An American Favorite</b>
People have eaten peanuts for thousands of years.
Peanuts first grew in South America. People started
growing them in the United States around 1818.
Over the years, many people ground peanuts to
make them easy to eat. Dr. John Kellogg made
a recipe for peanut butter around 1890. He wanted
people to eat peanut butter instead of meat.
In the 1900s, people built machines to make large
amounts of peanut butter. They also mixed in oil
to make peanut butter easier to spread.
Americans love peanut
butter. Some like smooth
peanut butter best, and
others like chunky best.
Overall, Americans eat
more than a million
pounds of peanut butter
every year!
