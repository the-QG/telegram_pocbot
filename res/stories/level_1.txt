<b>Home for lunch</b>
“What’s that?” asked Ana.
“Dad said to make lunch while he’s working,” said Juan.
“Are you calling that lunch?” she asked. She pointed at
something that looked like a pile of mush.
“I’m trying to build a banana house, but the banana
slices are too slippery,” said Juan.
“I can help,” Ana said, pulling a jar from the refrigerator
so that it could warm up.
When Dad walked in, he found a surprise. Ana and
Juan had built a house of food. Banana slabs held up
a corn-chip roof. Peanut butter held everything together
like glue.
Ana and Juan knew they would have to eat this mess.
But the look on Dad’s face was worth it!
